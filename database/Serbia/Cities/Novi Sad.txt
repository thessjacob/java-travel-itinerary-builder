A quaint city straddling the banks of the Danube, Novi Sad is the second-largest city in Serbia and is the capital of
the autonomous region of Vojvodina. The west/north bank of the city holds the city proper, including the University of Novi
Sad and the "Laze Teleƒçkog" street known for its lively nightlife. The eastern/southern bank holds Petrovaradin, a small, once
independent town that has been absorbed into Novi Sad. Novi Sad is also one of the main terminus points for the
Danube-Tisa-Danube canal system, which runs for almost 1000 km through the Vojvodina countryside.
