Subotica, or Szabadka, as it is known to its large Hungarian plurality, is a diverse city situated on Serbia's northern
border with Hungary. It is unique among Serbian cities due to the fact that a majority of its inhabitants practice Roman
Catholicism, as opposed to the more usual Serbian Orthodoxy. This is due to the fact that three of the city's largest
ethnic groups are traditionally catholic, whereas usually orthodox Serbs make up only 27%. Subotica's concentrated
diversity makes it a great place to get a taste of many cultures; there are beautiful orthodox and catholic churches,
plus a well-upkept synagogue representing the once large Jewish population of Subotica. Additionally, there are a number
of well-preserved exemplars of Vienna Succession Architecture, a turn-of-the-20th century style marked by intricate
detailing added to both the interior and exterior of structures.
