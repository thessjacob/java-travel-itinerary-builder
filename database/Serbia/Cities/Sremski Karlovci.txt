Sremski Karlovci (so called because it is Karlovci in the province of Srem) is a village a short distance outside the
south-eastern edge of Novi Sad. Once the capital of "Serbian Vojvodina", it is now a sleepy yet beautiful town most known for
its specialty language high school and its excellent wineries. Connected to Novi Sad by convenient exurban bus routes,
it is a great place to relax, either in a winery, in one of the village's many parks, or along the south bank of the Danube.
For those who love hiking, Sremski Karlovci is within walking distance of the east edge of Fru≈°ka Gora National Park, home
to the single, lone mountain in Vojvodina as well as a number of monasteries.
