Baščaršija is the traditional quarter and bizaare located in the heart of Sarajevo, Bosnia's capital. It is a surprising
and unexpected step into the past, when Bosnia was part of the Ottoman Empire, before the reorganizations of the late
19th and early 20th centuries. The small streets offer a combination of tourist fare, including small shops and a large
underground bazaar, as well as genuine local experiences, including the best Čevapdžinicas in the Balkans and an elegant
mosque that is still in daily use by locals.
