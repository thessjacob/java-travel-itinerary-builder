Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and the heart of the Federation, one of the two federal units of Bosnia. Home to the
Turkish Old Quarter, the hauntingly abandoned 1984 Olympic complex, and a number of museums chronicling the difficult
Bosnian War and siege of Sarajevo. A city surrounded by mountains, it possesses a beauty few other cities in the Balkans
can compare to.
