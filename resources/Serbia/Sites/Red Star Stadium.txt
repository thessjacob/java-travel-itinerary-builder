Red Star Stadium is Serbia's largest sporting stadium and home to Red Star (Crvena Zvezda) soccer club, Serbia's most
successful and enduring team. Red Star most famously won the European Championship in 1991, after besting perennial
favorite Bayern Munich in the semi-finals. Catch a match if possible, but be aware that matches between Partizan and
Red Star can be rowdy affairs that are not suitable for all tourists.
