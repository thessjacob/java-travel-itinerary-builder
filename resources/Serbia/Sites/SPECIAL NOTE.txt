Kosovo is a historical region of Serbia that declared independence in 2008, following more than a decade of conflict.


Kosovo is currently recognized by 101 UN members, but is still unrecognized by Serbia and so officially is listed by
Serbian tourism as part of Serbia; however, it is independently administrated by its majority Albanian population.


There are a number of Serbian sites to visit in the north of Kosovo (particularly monasteries), as well as a number of
culturally Albanian sites in the remainder of Kosovo.


It is recommended that if you wish to travel to Kosovo, you do so by passing into Kosovo through neighboring Albania or
Macedonia, rather than through the Serbia-Kosovo border.
