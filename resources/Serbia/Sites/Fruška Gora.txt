Fru≈°ka Gora is Vojvodina's sole mountain on Serbia's portion of the otherwise flat and unbroken Pannonian Plain. It is
a gorgeous national park surrounded by a number of historic monasteries. Those who like camping can find campsites on
the grounds of the parks; other travellers may enjoy multiple days on the mountain combined with relaxed evenings in
nearby Novi Sad or Sremski Karlovci.
