Fantast is a unique occurence--a historical castle built in the 20th century. It was built by a family hoping to show
off their wealth...which was then promptly appropriated by the communist Yugoslav government just several decades later.
Despite its relatively young age for a castle, the grounds are beautiful and the castle possess an interesting, almost
anachronistic architecture that can be a delight to see in person.
