Petrovaradin Fortress is an Austrian-built fortress overlooking the Danube. The small fortified town under the fortress
is Petrovaradin and was originally populated mostly by Catholics, whereas the larger Novi Sad across the river was populated
by Orthodox Serbs. Today they have merged into one city, although Novi Sad remains the larger of the two.


The Fortress has beautiful views of the Danube, an excellent national restaurant, and a clocktower with famously reversed
hands. It is also the site of the annual Exit festival, an international music festival attended by hundreds of thousands
each summer.
