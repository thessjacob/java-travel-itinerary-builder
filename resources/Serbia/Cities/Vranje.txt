Vranje is a unique city situated near the borders of Kosovo, Bulgaria, and Macedonia. While Niš may fairly be called the
heart of Southern Serbia, Vranje may claim to be its soul. It is a town that still remembers its Turkish roots, with
architecture and culture to match, including a pristinely preserved white stone Ottoman bridge, unsurpassed within the
borders of Serbia. It is in Vranje that one can best hear the national melodies that that Serbs most love, and feel the
home-grown emotions of "sevdah" and "merak" that can only be found in the company of good friends and amdist free
flowing drink (always rakija, the Serbian national drink). Vranje is also the home to a unique slavic language called
Torlaški, which can best be understood as an intermediate dialect between Serbian, Macedonian, and Bulgarian. In
addition to these intagible artifacts, Vranje is home to a national museum of history focused on the Turkish period,
has a well-preserved Ottoman hamam (bathhouse), and is close to several nature sites, including Besna Kobila and
Vranjska Banja.
