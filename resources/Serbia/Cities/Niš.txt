Niš is the third-largest city in Serbia and is the center of southern Serbia culture and life. An ancient settlement
where the Roman Emperor Constantine is believed to have been born, Niš today is the best window into a Serbian culture
that remains with one hand on the traditions of the Ottoman times, during which it was an Ottoman regional trading hub.
Today visitors can enjoy an expansive fortress that has been turned into a public park, walk along the Niševa river,
and enjoy traditional southern brass bands called Trubači that play at the local kafanas. Niš is also notable for being
a rare city in Europe where it is possible to see a Romani minority population that is at least partially integrated
into the local community. It is also an excellent site to try Serbian meat dishes, or to hope across the border on a
day trip to nearby Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria.
