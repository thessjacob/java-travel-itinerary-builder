Smederevo is just an hour or two down the Danube from Belgrade and is easily accessible by bus or train. The historic
capital of Serbia, it continues to punch above its weight despite being overshadowed in some ways by larger Serbian
cities. Principal sites to enjoy here are the historic fortress once occupied by Serbian kings and relaxed river cruises
offered by local boatmen. Smederevo is also situated on the south bank of the Danube across from the Eastern Vojvodina
province of Bačka, making it an alternative to Zrenjanin for exploring the many wineries of northeastern region. The
local varietal of grape--Smederevka--is in fact named after Smederevo. An hour north is also Deliblatska Peščara, an
interesting desert-like nature reserve that is open to the public.
