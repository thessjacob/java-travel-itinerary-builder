Zemun is technically now a district of Belgrade--but don't try to tell the people of Zemun that. Once an independent
city on the banks of the Danube upstream of Belgrade, it has managed to maintain an independent appeal despite its
incorporation into the capital region. It has its own theater, parks, and even a beautiful riverside walking path. It's
a great place to stay for visitors who wish to avoid the hustle and bustle of Belgrade proper while still having access
to the robust intercity public transport network in Serbia. It is also the best place in the capital region to listen
to Tambura≈°i, the traditional music played by stringed instruments that is most associated with Vojvodina to the north.
