Kruševac is a small city in central Serbia, accessible (as it is just off the A1 highway between Belgrade and Niš) but
seemingly off the beaten path. The historic home of Prince Lazar, a legendary Serbian hero of both history and epic
poetry, Kruševac is home to two medieval fortresses and to the Slobodište Monument Complex, one part of a series of
unique, Brutalist monuments created to honor the Yugoslav partisans that fought in World War II. While Kruševac itself
is small, it is a good base for visiting other parts of Central Serbia, as there are frequent tours of regional
monasteries as well as good access to nature sites like Jastrebac mountain and Kopaonik Ski Resort.
