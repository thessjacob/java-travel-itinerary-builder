Čačak is a small but proud city, famed for its love of music. Each year a village just outside the city hosts an
international brass band competition called Guča. Čačak, in the heart of Šumadija, is sometimes thought of the center
of traditional "Beli Orkestar" (white orchestra) Trubači, a type of brass heavy national music, although for a complete musical
experience, visitors will need to visit the south to listen to the opposing "Crni Orkestar" (black orchestra) style. Nature
lovers will enjoy Čačak's nearness to famous Serbian mountain Zlatibor, and ethnographically minded tourists may enjoy
Drvengrad, a nearby ethno-village. There are also a number of traditional banjas nearby for those interested in
wellness.
