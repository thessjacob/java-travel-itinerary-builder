Belgrade is the capital of Serbia and the heart of modern Serbia's contemporary culture. Sometimes considered a
crossroads of Europe and the Near East, Belgrade sits at the confluence of two large rivers, the Danube and the Sava.
It was also a major cultural connection point for the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian Empires, with Belgrade at times
serving as the border between the two. Historically minded tourists can step back into history in the Old City by
strolling down Knez Mihajlova Street, through the green parks of Kalamegdan Fortress, or past the Temple of St.Sava, one
of the largest churches in the world. More adventurous visitors will find much to do in the trendy Sava Mala district
along the east bank of the Sava. New Belgrade, a modern expansion of the city on the west bank of the Sava, hosts large
malls, an expansive bike path network, and a lovely riverside park that truly comes alive at night when the riverside
"Splav" clubs open their doors.
