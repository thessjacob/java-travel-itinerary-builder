Niška Banja is the most famous of the Serbian "banjas", which are usually translated as "spas". In fact, the banjas
are usually small villages with robust, nature focused resort infrastructure that was originally built during the time
of socialism. Niška Banja is place to go to rest and recharge, whether that means time spent on the resort grounds,
time spent in modest local restaurants, or in day trips to nature sites like neighboring Sićevo Canyon.
