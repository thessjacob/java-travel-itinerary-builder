Zrenjanin is the largest city in Banat, the least populated of Vojvodina's three provinces. It sits on the Bega River,
a canalized river that runs from just downstream of Zrenjanin, where it joins with the Tisa, all the way to Timi»ôoara in
the neighboring country of Romania. Despite its small size, Zrenjanin is an excellent exemplar of the Austro-Hungarian
architecture style found throughout Vojvodina, and it is a great base of operations for visiting wineries in the
northeast of Serbia.
